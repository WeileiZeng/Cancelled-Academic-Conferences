* Rationale:
  * Why track cancelled/postponed academic conferences? As an academic librarian, it's my job to help students, faculty, staff, and the public find the information they need in any form. I realized when conference cancellations started happening that someone, at some point, might find a list of them helpful. Knowing it would be easier to gather information as it happens rather than recreate it later, I threw this spreadsheet together & tweeted it out. Uses in the future could include economic and sustainability research, or potentially lots of areas I haven't even considered yet!

* Libraries' Role:
  * Please consider tagging in your academic library faculty/staff as many of you plan for and implement a transition to different forms of teaching and research due to COVID-19. Know that not all students/faculty/staff have home internet or fast home internet. Some don't have web-enabled devices or may only have a phone rather than a laptop or tablet. Important to consider how to support them, and your library may be able to help. Most academic libs already provide LOTS of remote services, including live chat, document delivery (we scan our physical materials & provide electronically), remote database access, electronic course reserves, etc.
